\value{
Adds items in the niche list and changing the class into \code{subniche} containing:

\code{factor} the factor use to divide the environmental and species matrix into submatrices.

\code{G_k} a dataframe with the sub-origins, \emph{G_k}.

\code{sub} a dataframe with the species subniche coordinates
}
\description{
The indexes allows to divide the niche, estimated from the \link[ade4]{niche} function in the \link{ade4} package into subniches defined by a factor, which creates the
subsets. See details for more information.

\details{
The Within Outlying Mean Index analysis is a statistical exploratory niche analysis which provides observation of niche shift and/or conservatism, of an entire community,at different subcales
(temporal ,spatial and/or finer biological organisation level), and comparable under the same environmental gradients. This hindcasting multivariate analysis is based on the OMI analysis (Doledec \emph{et al.} 2000) which is used as reference.
The niches refinement is inspired by the K-select (Calenge \emph{et al.} 2005) which emphasizes the limiting factors in habitat use in design II and III (Thomas and Taylor, 1990).The different estimations should help understand:

1. the environmental factors defining a species' reference niche, under on the full scale, within a community.

2. the environmental factors defining a species' subniches, under each subsets, within a community.

The subniches parameters can be calculated from both the reference origin,\emph{G}, which corresponds to the reference plan origin, and from \emph{G_k}, which corresponds to the
suborigins. \emph{G} is the graphical representation of the mean environmental conditions encountered over the full scale of the data. \emph{G_k} is the mean environmental conditions
encountered at a subset defined by the factor. They are complementary has you can compare:

1. a single species' subniches to \emph{G}.

2. the community' subniches to \emph{G_k} at a specific subset.

 The subniches of a single species can only be compared to \emph{G} as it is the common origin to all subsets. Whereas \emph{G_k} is only common to the species found within the
subset. So comparing different subniches of one species, found within different subsets, is only relevant to \emph{G}. The community's subniches can be compared to both \emph{G}
and \emph{G_k}, but \emph{G}, being the mean environmental conditions found within the full scale, will not express the specificity of the environmental conditions that the species
encountered at the subset. \emph{G_k}, being the mean environmental conditions of the subset, will reflect the atypical value of the environmental condition, making the
comparison of the community's subniches parameters more relevant.
